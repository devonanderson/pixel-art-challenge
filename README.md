# Pixel Art Challenge

Build an app that allows the user to create pixel art on an **NxN** grid. Clicking on a square in the grid will change the squares color. The colors will cycle through 5 different colors **(red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple)**. Each successive click on a square will advance the square to the next color. Users should be able to **save** their artwork to a database, and **load** previously saved artwork.
